## Chat Render Example

<https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1060681/197653099-c3fd12c2-f03a-4580-84e4-63ce3f36be8d.mp4>

## What can it do?

- Download Twitch VODs
- Download Twitch Clips
- Download chat for VODs and Clips, in either a [JSON with all the original information](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/files/13495494/ExampleMoonMoonJsonFile.json), a browser HTML file, or a [plain text file](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/files/13495523/ExampleMoonMoonTextFile.txt)
- Update the contents of a previously generated JSON chat file with an option to save as another format
- Use a previously generated JSON chat file to render the chat with Twitter Twemoji or Google Noto Color emojis and BTTV, FFZ, 7TV static and animated emotes

# GUI

## Windows WPF

![](https://i.imgur.com/bLegxGX.gif)

### [See the full WPF documentation here](TwitchDownloaderWPF/README.md)

### Functionality

The Windows WPF GUI implements all of the main functions of the program along with some extra quality of life functions:

- Queue up multiple download/render jobs to run simultaneously
- Create a list of download jobs from a list of vod/clip links
- Search for and download multiple VODs/clips from any streamer without leaving the app

### Multi-language Support

The Windows WPF GUI is available in multiple languages thanks to community translations. See the [Localization section](TwitchDownloaderWPF/README.md#localization) of the [WPF README](TwitchDownloaderWPF/README.md) for more details.

### Theming

The Windows WPF GUI comes bundled with both light and dark themes, along with an option to update live according the current Windows theme. It also supports user created themes! See the [Theming section](TwitchDownloaderWPF/README.md#theming) of the [WPF README](TwitchDownloaderWPF/README.md) for more details.

### Video Demonstration

(older version, same concept)

## Linux?

Check twitch-downloader-gui on [github](https://github.com/mohad12211/twitch-downloader-gui) or on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/twitch-downloader-gui) for a Linux GUI wrapper for the CLI.

## MacOS?

No GUI is available for MacOS yet :(

# CLI

### [See the full CLI documentation here](TwitchDownloaderCLI/README.md)

The CLI is cross-platform and implements the main functions of the program. It works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS<sup>*</sup>.

<sup>*Only Intel Macs have been tested</sup>

With the CLI, it is possible to automate video processing using external scripts. For example, you could copy-paste the following code into a `.bat` file on Windows to download a VOD and its chat, and then render the chat, all from a single input.

```bat
@echo off
set /p vodid="Enter VOD ID: "
TwitchDownloaderCLI.exe videodownload --id %vodid% --ffmpeg-path "ffmpeg.exe" -o %vodid%.mp4
TwitchDownloaderCLI.exe chatdownload --id %vodid% -o %vodid%_chat.json -E
TwitchDownloaderCLI.exe chatrender -i %vodid%_chat.json -h 1080 -w 422 --framerate 30 --update-rate 0 --font-size 18 -o %vodid%_chat.mp4
```

## Windows - Getting started

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/releases/) and download the latest version for Windows or [build from source](#building-from-source).
2. Extract `TwitchDownloaderCLI.exe`.
3. Browse to where you extracted the executable:

```
cd C:\folder\containing\TwitchDownloaderCLI
```

4. If you do not have FFmpeg, you can install it via [Chocolatey package manager](https://community.chocolatey.org/), or you can get it as a standalone file from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or by using TwitchDownloaderCLI:

```
TwitchDownloaderCLI.exe ffmpeg --download
```

5. You can now start using TwitchDownloaderCLI, for example:

```
TwitchDownloaderCLI.exe videodownload --id <vod-id-here> -o out.mp4
```

You can find more example commands in the [CLI README](TwitchDownloaderCLI/README.md#example-commands).

## Linux – Getting started

1. Some distros, like Linux Alpine, lack fonts for some languages (Arabic, Persian, Thai, etc.) If this is the case for you, install additional fonts families such as [Noto](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans) or check your distro's wiki page on fonts as it may have an install command for this specific scenario, such as the [Linux Alpine](https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Fonts) font page.
2. Ensure both `fontconfig` and `libfontconfig1` are installed. `apt-get install fontconfig libfontconfig1` on Ubuntu.
3. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/releases/) and download the latest binary for Linux, grab the [AUR Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/twitch-downloader-bin/) for Arch Linux, or [build from source](#building-from-source).
4. Extract `TwitchDownloaderCLI`.
5. Browse to where you extracted the binary:

```
cd directory/containing/TwitchDownloaderCLI
```

6. Give the binary executable rights:

```
sudo chmod +x TwitchDownloaderCLI
```

7. a) If you do not have FFmpeg, you should install it system-wide via your distro package manager, however you can also get it as a standalone file from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or by using TwitchDownloaderCLI:

```
./TwitchDownloaderCLI ffmpeg --download
```

7. b) If downloaded as a standalone file, you must also give it executable rights with:

```
sudo chmod +x ffmpeg
```

8. You can now start using TwitchDownloaderCLI, for example:

```
./TwitchDownloaderCLI videodownload --id <vod-id-here> -o out.mp4
```

You can find more example commands in the [CLI README](TwitchDownloaderCLI/README.md#example-commands).

## MacOS – Getting started

1. If your device has an Apple Silicon M-series processor, ensure that you download the arm64 binary, however if you would like to use the x64 binary on Apple Silicon it must be run via a terminal session running under Rosetta 2:

```
arch -x86_64 zsh
```

2. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/releases/) and download the latest binary for MacOS or [build from source](#building-from-source).
3. Extract `TwitchDownloaderCLI`.
4. Browse to where you extracted the binary:

```
cd directory/containing/TwitchDownloaderCLI
```

5. Give the binary executable rights in the terminal:

```
chmod +x TwitchDownloaderCLI
```

6. a) If you do not have FFmpeg, you can install it system-wide via the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/), or you can get it as a standalone file from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or by using TwitchDownloaderCLI:

```
./TwitchDownloaderCLI ffmpeg --download
```

6. b) If downloaded as a standalone file, you must also give it executable rights with:

```
chmod +x ffmpeg
```

7. You can now start using TwitchDownloaderCLI, for example:

```
./TwitchDownloaderCLI videodownload --id <vod-id-here> -o out.mp4
```

You can find more example commands in the [CLI README](TwitchDownloaderCLI/README.md#example-commands).
