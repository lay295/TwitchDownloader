## Chat Render Example

## What can it do?
- Download Twitch VODs
- Download Twitch Clips
- Download chat for VODS and Clips, in either a [JSON with all the information](https://pastebin.com/raw/YDgRe6X4) or a [simple text file](https://pastebin.com/raw/016azeQX)
- Use a previously generated JSON chat file to render the chat with FFZ, BTTV and 7TV support (including GIFS)

## Video Demonstration

(older version, same concept)

## Linux?

Check twitch-downloader-gui on [github](https://github.com/mohad12211/twitch-downloader-gui) or on the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/twitch-downloader-gui) for a Linux GUI wrapper for the CLI.

## MacOS?

No GUI is avaiable for MacOS yet :(

# CLI

The CLI is cross platform and performs the main functions of the program. It works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.*

*As of 1.50.5, only `VideoDownload`, `ClipDownload`, and `ChatDownload` **without embeded emotes** are known to work on MacOS. Only Intel Macs have been tested

### [CLI Documentation here](TwitchDownloaderCLI/README.md). 

I've never really made a command line utility before so things may change in the future. If you're on Linux, make sure `fontconfig` and `libfontconfig1` are installed `(apt-get install fontconfig libfontconfig1)`.

For example, you could copy/paste this into a `.bat` file on Windows, to download a VOD, chat, and then render in a single go.  
```
@echo off
set /p vodid="Enter VOD ID: "
TwitchDownloaderCLI -m VideoDownload --id %vodid% --ffmpeg-path "ffmpeg.exe" -o %vodid%.mp4
TwitchDownloaderCLI -m ChatDownload --id %vodid% -o %vodid%_chat.json
TwitchDownloaderCLI -m ChatRender -i %vodid%_chat.json -h 1080 -w 422 --framerate 30 --update-rate 0 --font-size 18 -o %vodid%_chat.mp4
```

### Linux – Getting started

1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/releases/) and download the latest version for Linux.
2. Extract `TwitchDownloaderCLI`
3. Browse to where you extracted the file and give it executable rights in Terminal:
```
sudo chmod +x TwitchDownloaderCLI
```
4. If you do not have ffmpeg, you should install it via your distro package manager, however you can also get it as a standalone file from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or by using TwitchDownloaderCLI:
```
./TwitchDownloaderCLI --download-ffmpeg
```
If downloaded as a standalone file, you must also give it executable rights with:
```
sudo chmod +x ffmpeg
```
5. You can now start using the downloader, for example:
```
./TwitchDownloaderCLI -m VideoDownload --id <vod-id-here> -o out.mp4
```
For Arch Linux, there's an [AUR Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/twitch-downloader-bin/)

### MacOS – Getting started
1. Go to [Releases](https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader/releases/) and download the latest version for MacOS.
2. Extract `TwitchDownloaderCLI`
3. Browse to where you extracted the file and give it executable rights in Terminal:
```
chmod +x TwitchDownloaderCLI
```
4. If you do not have ffmpeg, you can install it via [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/), or you can get it as a standalone file from [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or by using TwitchDownloaderCLI:
```
./TwitchDownloaderCLI --download-ffmpeg
```
If downloaded as a standalone file, you must also give it executable rights with:
```
chmod +x ffmpeg
```
5. You can now start using the downloader, for example:
```
./TwitchDownloaderCLI -m VideoDownload --id <vod-id-here> -o out.mp4
```
